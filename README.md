### Cryptocurrency: A Smart Contract for Shared Inventory (Blockchain)

Many retailers in Trinidad and Tobago have a hard time with inventory. Decisions must be made in order
to know whether the owners will have enough cash on hand for the rest of the month, or that there will
be excess cash to purchase more inventory. One way to bring down costs in purchasing inventory, is for
multiple small retailers to combine their inventories, and order from suppliers when they can get price
discounts for large wholesale purchases. 

> This project proposes utilizing cryptocurrency smart contracts as a method to alert retailers who have
shared interests when they have a combined inventory deficit such that they can purchase goods in
wholesale together.
